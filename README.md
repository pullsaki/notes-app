# Notes App
###### A simple note taking app made using Material UI framework

## Usage
- clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/pullsaki/notes-app.git` on your terminal
- Install the dependencies with `npm install` command
- Install and setup JSON server package using the following commands
  - Install the package with `npm install -g json-server`
  - Start the JSON server on 8000 port using this command `json-server --watch db.json --port 8000`
  - Check https://localhost:8000 to view the database on JSON server and keep the terminal running
 - Start another terminal and enter `npm start` to start the app

#### Progress
I have implemented most of the Material UI elements I know and a new package called JSON server using this app. One thing I want to do is to move this from JSON server to firebase so that I can easily deploy the app on netlify
